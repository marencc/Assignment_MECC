# Employee Attrition - Case Study (Data Scientist)

## Business Problem
Attrition is a problem that impacts all businesses and it leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff and training new staff. 

Therefore, businesses, in particular their HR departments have great interest in understanding the drivers of, and minimizing staff attrition. The use of classification models to predict if an employee is likely to quit could greatly increase HRâ€™s ability to intervene on time and remedy the situation to prevent attrition.

## Dataset
The main data source is the `employee-attrition.csv` file that contains 1470 HR entries.  Given the limited size of the data set, the model should only be expected to provide modest improvement in identification of attrition vs a random allocation of probability of attrition.

## Instructions

1. Implement a solution to the above business problem that you feel comfortable with presenting to your potential colleagues. You can assume that the colleagues have a data science background and you do not have to explain math and algorithms.

1. Python and its scientific libraries are the preferred toolchain but feel free to use a different toolchain if that allows you to deliver higher quality results. 

1. Explore/analyse the data to understand it well enough to proceed. Present the findings in a way that it is easy for the audience to understand the data. 

1. Build the machine learning model(s) that you think are the right one to solve the problem. Please be able to explain why you chose a given approach. 

1. Clearly present how you evaluated your approach and show the results.

    **Note**: As part of your presentation, you will be expected to show the code you have written. You are free to use the code editor of your choice. If you code everything in a Jupyter notebook and use that for the presentation that is totally great.

1. If anything is unclear, please make assumptions and document them. 

1. The implementation does not have to be perfect but please be able to explain next steps in optimizing the model, etc. 

1. You do not need to submit anything before the presentation if you bring your own laptop for the presentation. Otherwise please submit the presentation material ahead of time. 

1. Please prepare any material in English.
